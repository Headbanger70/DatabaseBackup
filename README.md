DatabaseBackup
==============

KeePass Plug-In to Automatically Back your Database Up.

History
-------
This plug-in was originally developed by Francis Noël.  I just picked it up and started making modifications because I was curious and thought I could help by cleaning it up a bit and maybe throw some features.  The version I started with can be found on the [official KeePass plug-in page](http://keepass.info/plugins.html#databasebackup).
