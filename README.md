DatabaseBackup
==============

KeePass Plug-In to Automatically Back your Database Up.

History
-------
This plug-in was originally developed by Francis Noël.  Dean Glazeski just picked it up and started making modifications because he was curious and thought he could help by cleaning it up a bit and maybe throw in some new features.  The version he started with can be found on the [official KeePass plug-in page](http://keepass.info/plugins.html#databasebackup).

Also the above description is from Dean. I simply took the plugin (starting with the version from Noël) and added a feature I call "Advanced Backup History" (ie., not a flat directory containing the last *n* backups of the database, but - in short - a list of directories containing the last backups of today, yesterday, the last weeks, months, and years). After implementing this feature I discovered the plugin version of Dean and integrated my extension into it.
